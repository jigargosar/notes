## Clean Code Notes

### Video: clean code remake

- Rigid: modules break other modules, compile/test phase.
- Fragile: seemingly insignificant changes, break other parts of the system. e.g: relying on menu string as a client interface to api.
- Inseparable: Parts that can be profitably used in another system cannot be separated.



### Clean Code Book notes:


#### chapter 1

> And what about Ward’s notion of beauty? We’ve all railed against the fact that our languages weren’t designed for our problems. But Ward’s statement puts the onus back on us. He says that beautiful code makes the language look like it was made for the problem! So it’s our responsibility to make the language look simple! Language bigots everywhere, beware! 

> **It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that make the language appear simple!**


**Schools of Thought**: wishing a martial art style there is right way to practice but not outside. After gaining sufficient exp students may study other schools to broaden their horizons. We are not right in any absolute sense.

**My Idea from the emacs recording keystrokes and replaying it;)**: how about recording a programming session and viewing it after 30 mins, this will be fun! a way to program in chunks of 30 mins. Nice way to practice this discipline ;)

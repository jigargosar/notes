## Tweet/save things that I discover, automatically

* Need a way to quick push things that I encounter.
* small things like links, products, tools, pics. 
* we do have twitter. we could take a screenshot and post it with a comment.
* also I would like to save the content on git or some repository, and from there push to twitter ;)
* for now I will tweet manually.
